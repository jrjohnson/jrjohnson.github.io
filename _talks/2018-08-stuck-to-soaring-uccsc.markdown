When we set out to re-write Ilios in 2014 the most important metric we targeted with every decision was confidence. Developers had to be confident in every change,  and users needed to be confident in every release. This meant building code on well tested foundations, choosing technologies that favored stable releases over breaking changes, and adopting a culture of agile project management and test driven development.

In 2017 we averaged a deploy every other week! When it is necessary we can get bug fixes out to our users in minutes and we are so confident in each release that  we usually deploy our changes on Friday nights.

This talk will cover the practical tools and technologies we use, but more importantly, I will discus the mechanisms from code review to project planning that allow us to keep our team's velocity so high.
