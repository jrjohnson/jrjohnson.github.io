The Ilios Project at UCSF uses a LOT of open source software. From PHP and Javascript to Atom Symfony and Ember.js our entire application depends on code written by other people and made available for free (often in the cloud!). We give back to the community by open sourcing our own code and contributing wherever and whenever we can. YOU CAN GIVE BACK TOO! You don't need to write a single line of code. Every single project in the world needs some help.
