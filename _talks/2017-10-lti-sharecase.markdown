In July a brand new Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) tool was rolled out to connect students using the Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE) to their class schedules in Ilios. Leveraging the LTI standard, Amazon's Lambda serverless architecture, UCSF Enterprise Directory Service (EDS), and the Ilios REST API this integration was rolled out quickly with mission critical reliability and scalability. Come and see how we brought together these services to address a long standing student issue.

See how we are putting individual authenticated content in front of students in their own learning environment using the LTI standard and AWS Lambda.
