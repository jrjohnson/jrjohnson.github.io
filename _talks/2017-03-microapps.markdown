##Details
When building educational technology for UCSF we must be able to respond rapidly to ideas sparked by faculty and students for whom every wasted minute is an obstacle in the path of treating patients and curing disease. At the same time we need to ensure that prototype ideas which gain traction can be scaled to a large audience immediately.

This talk is about the parts of EmberJS that make it possible for my team to stop saying no and build applications at a pace we never imagined before. By taking advantage of the conventional pattern of EmberJS and a standard group of addons we can quickly produce minimally featured applications that don't kill long term productivity by becoming a long term maintenance burden.

Critical Points:
- Semantic versioning lets us skip versions without worrying about issues
- Deprecations make it possible to prepare for upgrade with spare cycles
- Having a common standard build chain (ember-cli) makes it simple to switch projects and onboard new team members.
- Deployment can be specified and customized for each app while maintaining a standard deploy.js file that is easy to understand.
- Share common functionality in addons
- Connect to any API with adapters
