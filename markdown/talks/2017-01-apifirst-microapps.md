Microapplications, like microservices, allow organizations to break down frontend monoliths into workable parts. These smaller pieces can be organized by the Single Responsibility Principle into individual single page applications. This allows small teams to build and throw away pieces of functionality without disturbing the entire ecosystem. For developers, rapid iteration and disposability creates opportunities to try out new technologies and techniques.

The Ilios Project (iliosproject.org) is building microapplications to serve the needs of our students using Symfony and EmberJS. Symfony provides a base to serve and organize applications, thanks to Symfony's world-class dependency injection, configuration, and templating capabilities.

Covers:
- Applications hosted with a CDN
- Parsing index.html
- Thinking about assets
- Organizing configuration and injecting it through templating
- Keeping up to date
- Notifying users that their app is out of date through polling or websockets.
