Abstract for [2019 Information Security Symposium](https://infosecsymposium.ucdavis.edu/event-information/)

See how the Ilios Project at UCSF leverages our application tests, 
Github's Pull Requests, update bots, and automated container builds, 
to ensure that our small team can keep our application dependencies 
and OS packages constantly up to date.

Ilios has seamlessly upgraded through several major versions of two 
web frameworks, Linux distros, and innumerable security and 
feature updates to thousands of dependencies and libraries
 since v3 was launched in 2015. By focusing on writing great tests 
 and leveraging automation and bots, we're able to keep each update 
 small and easily applied. This takes the drama out of staying up 
 to date, and allows us to update several times a week without 
 slowing down.

Testing for security goes hand in hand with testing for user experience, 
and combining the two yields amazing benefits.
